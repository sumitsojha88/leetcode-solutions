Approach:
1) we well calculate total sum first right down and than top left
2) we will calculate value at m[n/2][n/2] which is centre element
3) if matrix is odd than we will minus that element ekse we will return sum

Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]]
Output: 25
Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.
Example 2:

Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1]]
Output: 8
Example 3:

Input: mat = [[5]]
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

n == mat.length == mat[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100
